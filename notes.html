            Lexical Environment exists in which <b>where</b> you write something is important.

            It basically tells where is it written and what surrounds it.

            For example:
            <pre>
        <code>
            var b = "b";

            function abc(){

            It not only contains our code but it also contains things written by syntax parser to run code.

            Even though it's not even on the execution stack anymore.
            <br>
            And this way we say that the execution context has closed in its outer variables, <br>

            the variables that it would normally have reference to anyway. <br>
